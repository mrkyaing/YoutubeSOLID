# SOLID Principle in Software Engineering 
## Single Responsibility
  a class should only have one responsibility. Furthermore, it should only have one reason to change.

## Open-Closed 
- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. In doing so, we stop ourselves from modifying existing code and causing potential new bugs in an otherwise happy application.
## Liskov Substitution
- Derived or child classes must be substitutable for their base or parent classes
## Interface Segregation
## Dependency Inversion
